# Flights of Fancy

Flights of Fancy is a bird sound classifier, trained on the BirdCLEF dataset, which comprises over 36,000 recordings of bird calls across 1,500 species native to Central and South America.

Run `git clone https://github.com/aquietlife/flightsoffancy` and then `jupyter notebook` to view the notebook locally.

The notebook has a lot of images so it won't load directly in Github.

For more information, check out my [blog post](http://aquiet.life/software/flightsoffancy) on this project.
